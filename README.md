## INTRODUCTION
This project was crafted as the capstone of a "Data Analytics Bootcamp" by a team of three data enthusiasts, diving into the vast world of film data to tackle a challenging, real-world question: What makes a movie a hit?
Armed with a robust dataset from IMDb—the world's largest movie database—we took on the task of sifting through a massive amount of film information. But we didn’t stop there! To deepen our analysis, we harnessed additional data from The Numbers, Box Office Mojo, and the European Audiovisual Observatory, gathered through web scraping techniques.
The project centered around a fictional but insightful scenario: uncovering key insights about the current worldwide movie market and pinpointing the critical factors that drive a film’s success. In the end, our findings were showcased in a lively presentation, bringing our audience along on a data-driven journey through Hollywood and other markets hits, box office trends, and the secrets of cinematic success.
